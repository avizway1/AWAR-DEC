### What is Vim Editor?  
Vim (short for **Vi IMproved**) is a powerful, feature-rich text editor designed for efficient text manipulation and editing. It is based on the **vi** editor but includes several enhancements, such as syntax highlighting, undo/redo functionality, and support for plugins. Vim is commonly used in Linux and Unix systems for editing configuration files, programming, and general text editing tasks.
