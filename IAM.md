### Root User  
The **Root User** is the account owner who logs into AWS using the email address and password provided during the account creation process.  
- **Key Points about the Root User:**  
  - The root user has **unrestricted access** to the AWS account.  
  - It can perform critical actions such as:  
    - Changing support plans.  
    - Modifying payment methods.  
    - Closing the AWS account.  
    - Transferring the account ownership.  
  - **Security Tip:** Secure the root user account by enabling **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** or two-factor authentication.  

#### Why is there only one Root User?  
- Each AWS account is associated with a **single root user** because only one email ID can be used to create the account.  
- If you log in using this email ID, you are accessing the account as the root user.

### IAM User (Identity and Access Management User)  
IAM allows you to create users and groups and manage permissions for them within your AWS account.  
- **Key Concepts:**  
  - **IAM Users**: Individuals who need access to AWS resources.  
  - **Groups**: Logical grouping of users to manage permissions collectively.  
  - **Policies**: JSON-based documents that define permissions for AWS services.  
    - For example: The **least privilege mechanism** ensures users have only the permissions needed for their job duties and nothing more.  

#### Why Create IAM Users?  
Consider a scenario where two AWS administrators hire a junior employee to just monitor resources:  
- Junior resource may create/modify/delete resource, if we share root credentials.  
- Assign the **ReadOnlyAccess** policy to allow monitoring but restrict the ability to modify resources.  
- This follows the **least privilege principle** by granting only the permissions required for their role.  

##### Should Root Credentials Be Shared?  
**No.** Sharing root credentials is highly discouraged as it can compromise the entire AWS account. Instead, use IAM users with appropriate policies.

### Roles and Permissions for IAM Users  

| **Role**          | **Responsibilities**                                                                                      | **Example Policy**            |  
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|  
| **AWS Administrator** | Creates and manages AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, VPCs, and databases.                         | `AdministratorAccess` policy  |  
| **Developer**       | Limited access to specific resources, as required for development purposes.                              | Custom policies for resources |  
| **DBA**             | Manages databases, provides database access, and performs backup operations.                             | `DBAdminAccess` policy        |  
| **Support Team**    | Monitors resources, identifies abnormalities, and alerts appropriate teams for resolution.               | `ReadOnlyAccess` policy       |

### Authentication and Authorization  

| **Term**           | **Definition**                                                                                           |  
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Authentication** | Verifying identity using credentials such as a username and password.                                    |  
| **Authorization**  | Defining what resources or actions a user is allowed to access after authentication.                     |  

#### Example of Authorization in Action:  
- A user logs in successfully but has limited permissions.  
- If the user attempts to perform an unauthorized action, AWS will respond with:  
  - **Error Message**: "You are not authorized to perform this operation."  
  - Common reasons: Permissions denied, not allowed to access certain resources, or lack of required policies.
