# AWS Logging, Monitoring, and Optimization Services

## Amazon CloudTrail

**Overview:**  
Amazon CloudTrail is a comprehensive logging service that records API calls and activity across your AWS account. It provides a complete audit trail for actions performed on AWS resources, helping you maintain compliance, enhance security, and troubleshoot issues.

**Key Points:**

- **Default Logging and Retention:**  
  CloudTrail is enabled by default and records management events (control plane operations) for 90 days. These events include operations that modify your AWS resources.
  
- **Extended Retention:**  
  To store logs for a longer period, create a CloudTrail trail that delivers logs to an Amazon S3 bucket. This setup enables you to retain logs indefinitely, subject to your lifecycle management policies.

- **Types of Events:**
  - **Management Events:**  
    Provide details about operations performed on AWS resources (e.g., creation, modification, deletion). These are often referred to as control plane events.
  - **Data Events:**  
    Record resource-level operations (data plane activities) such as S3 object-level API calls, DynamoDB table operations, and Lambda function invocations. Data events are high in volume and provide granular insight.
  - **Insight Events:**  
    Capture unusual activity in your AWS account, enabling you to detect anomalies that may indicate security incidents or operational issues.

- **Can we monitor EC2 Instance logs with CloudTrail.?**  
  No, You can install the CloudWatch Agent on your EC2 instances to collect custom OS-level logs and metrics, which can be forwarded to CloudWatch Logs for real-time monitoring.

- **Centralized Logging:**  
  In real-world environments, organizations often create separate trails for management events, data events, and insights, aggregating logs from all accounts into a centralized logging account. This simplifies compliance audits by granting external auditors access only to the logging account.

**Additional Tools for Log Analysis:**  
- CloudCheckr, DataDog, Splunk, and Site24x7 can integrate with CloudTrail logs to provide enhanced analytics, visualization, and alerting capabilities.

## AWS Config

**Overview:**  
AWS Config is a service that continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and evaluates them against desired settings and compliance policies. It helps ensure that your AWS environment adheres to organizational standards and regulatory requirements.

**Key Points:**

- **Configuration Recording:**  
  AWS Config captures detailed configuration histories of your AWS resources, making it easier to audit changes over time.
  
- **Compliance Evaluation:**  
  You can create rules (either custom or managed) to verify that resources comply with specific policies. For example:
  - No S3 bucket should have public access.
  - SSL certificates must not be expired.
  - No EBS snapshot should be publicly accessible.

- **No Free Tier:**  
  AWS Config is not part of the free tier, so costs are incurred based on the number of configuration items recorded and evaluated.

- **Integration with CloudTrail:**  
  AWS Config works alongside CloudTrail to provide a complete picture of changes in your AWS environment.

## Amazon CloudFront

**Overview:**  
Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that accelerates the delivery of your web content to end users globally by caching copies of content at edge locations. It enhances performance, reduces latency, and provides security features to protect against DDoS attacks.

**Key Points:**

- **DDoS Protection:**  
  CloudFront includes features that help protect your resources from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
  
- **Cache Invalidation:**  
  To ensure that users receive the most up-to-date content, you can perform cache invalidation, which clears cached content from CloudFront edge locations.
  
- **Caching Settings:**  
  - **Default TTL:** 86,400 seconds (1 day)  
  - **Maximum TTL:** Up to 365 days
  - Adjust these settings based on how frequently your content changes.
  
- **SSL/TLS Integration:**  
  Create an SSL certificate in the AWS region (typically N. Virginia) to associate with your CloudFront distribution for secure content delivery.
  
- **Geo-Restrictions:**  
  Based on the geographic location of end users, CloudFront allows you to whitelist or block traffic, ensuring that content is delivered only to approved regions.
