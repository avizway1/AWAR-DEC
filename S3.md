### **S3: Simple Storage Service**

---

#### **Object-Based Storage**
- **Definition:** Designed for storing flat files like documents, images, videos, and backups. Applications and operating systems cannot be installed or run on S3.  
  **Examples:** Dropbox, Google Drive.

---

#### **Storage Types Comparison**
1. **Block-Based Storage:**
   - Designed for running operating systems and applications.
   - Examples: EBS, Instance Store Volumes (used with EC2 instances).
2. **File-Based Storage:**
   - Network-based storage mounted to multiple devices.
   - Examples: EFS, FSx (used with EC2 instances).

---

#### **Key Features of S3**
- **Object Storage:** Ideal for storing flat files like logs, images, and videos.
- **Data Organization:** Data is stored in **buckets**.
- **Global Uniqueness:** Bucket names must be unique across all AWS accounts globally.
- **Soft Limit:** By default, an account can create up to 100 buckets (this can be increased upon request).
- **Scalability:** Unlimited data can be stored within a bucket.
- **No Pre-Provisioning:** Automatically scales as data is added.
  
---

#### **Bucket Naming Rules**
1. **Length:** Minimum 3 characters, maximum 63 characters.
2. **Character Restrictions:**
   - Must use lowercase letters and numbers.
   - Cannot start or end with a period (`.`).
   - Adjacent periods (`..`) are not allowed.
   - Must not resemble an IP address (e.g., `192.168.100.1`).

---

#### **Object Storage Details**
- **Object Size:** Minimum size: **0 bytes**, Maximum size: **5 TB**.
- **Region-Specific:** While S3 is a global service, the data resides in the AWS Region's Availability Zones (AZs) where the bucket is created.

#### **Example URLs:**
1. **Path-Style URL (Legacy):** `https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname`
2. **Virtual-Hosted URL:** 
   - `https://bucketname.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/objectname`
   - `https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname`
3. **Note:** Virtual paths won't work for bucket names containing periods (`.`).

---

#### **Making an Object Public**
1. **Account-Level Blocking:**
   - Ensure "Block Public Access" is disabled at the account level.
2. **Bucket-Level Blocking:**
   - Disable "Block Public Access" for the specific bucket.
3. **Object-Level Setting:**
   - Use ACLs to make the object public:
     - Navigate to the object → Actions → Make public using ACL.

---

#### **Free Tier Eligibility**
- **5 GB** Standard Storage.
- **2,000 PUT** (uploads) / **20,000 GET** (downloads).

### **We have total 3 types of buckets.**
- general Purpose bucket
- Directory Bucket
- Table bucket
---

### **1. General Purpose Buckets**
- **Description:**  
  General Purpose Buckets are the original S3 bucket type, suitable for most use cases and access patterns. They support a wide range of storage classes, except for specific single-zone storage classes like **S3 Express One Zone** and **S3 One Zone-IA** in AWS Local Zones.

- **Primary Use Cases:**  
  - Storing frequently or infrequently accessed data across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).  
  - General-purpose storage for web applications, media hosting, or data backups.  
  - Use cases requiring high durability and availability across multiple AZs.

- **Supported Storage Classes:**  
  - **S3 Standard**  
  - **S3 Standard-IA**  
  - **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval**  
  - **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**  

---

### **2. Directory Buckets**
- **Description:**  
  Directory Buckets are designed for specific use cases requiring low-latency or data residency, allowing bucket creation in a specific location such as an Availability Zone or a Local Zone.  
  - **Availability Zone (AZ):** Supports the **S3 Express One Zone** storage class for low-latency, high-performance workloads.  
  - **Local Zone:** Supports the **S3 One Zone-IA (Z-IA)** storage class for data residency requirements.

- **Primary Use Cases:**  
  - **High-Performance Workloads:**  
    - For latency-sensitive applications requiring single-digit millisecond PUT and GET operations in an AZ.  
    - Example: Analytics or real-time processing.  
  - **Data Residency Workloads:**  
    - Storing data in a specific AWS Local Zone to meet residency or compliance requirements.  

- **Supported Storage Classes:**  
  - **S3 Express One Zone** (for Availability Zone workloads).  
  - **S3 One Zone-IA** (for Local Zone workloads).  

---

### **3. Table Buckets**
- **Description:**  
  Table Buckets are used to store structured or tabular data, often serialized in formats like JSON, CSV, Parquet, or Avro. These buckets are optimized for use in data lakes and analytics workflows.

- **Primary Use Cases:**  
  - **Data Analytics:**  
    - Storing structured data for querying using tools like Amazon Athena, AWS Glue, or Redshift Spectrum.  
  - **Data Lakes:**  
    - Serving as a central repository for data that can be processed and analyzed.  
  - **Database Export/Import:**  
    - Exporting and importing tabular data to and from relational or NoSQL databases.  

- **Common File Formats:**  
  - JSON, CSV, Parquet, Avro.
