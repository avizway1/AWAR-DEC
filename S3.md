### **S3: Simple Storage Service**

---

#### **Object-Based Storage**
- **Definition:** Designed for storing flat files like documents, images, videos, and backups. Applications and operating systems cannot be installed or run on S3.  
  **Examples:** Dropbox, Google Drive.

---

#### **Other Storage Types**
1. **Block-Based Storage:**
   - Designed for running operating systems and applications.
   - Examples: EBS, Instance Store Volumes (used with EC2 instances).
2. **File-Based Storage:**
   - Network-based storage mounted to multiple devices.
   - Examples: EFS, FSx (used with EC2 instances).

---

#### **Key Features of S3**
- **Object Storage:** Ideal for storing flat files like logs, images, and videos.
- **Data Organization:** Data is stored in **buckets**.
- **Global Uniqueness:** Bucket names must be unique across all AWS accounts globally.
- **Soft Limit:** By default, an account can create up to 10000 buckets.
- **Scalability:** Unlimited data can be stored within a bucket.
- **No Pre-Provisioning:** Automatically scales as data is added.
  
---

#### **Bucket Naming Rules**
1. **Length:** Minimum 3 characters, maximum 63 characters.
2. **Character Restrictions:**
   - Must use lowercase letters and numbers.
   - Cannot start or end with a period (`.`).
   - Adjacent periods (`..`) are not allowed.
   - Must not resemble an IP address (e.g., `192.168.100.1`).

---

#### **Free Tier Eligibility**
- **5 GB** Standard Storage.
- **2,000 PUT** (uploads) / **20,000 GET** (downloads).

---

#### **Object Storage Details**
- **Object Size:** Minimum size: **0 bytes**, Maximum size: **5 TB**.
- **Region-Specific:** While S3 is a global service, the data resides in the AWS Region's Availability Zones (AZs) where the bucket is created.

#### **Example URLs:**
1. **Path-Style URL (Legacy):** `https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname`
2. **Virtual-Hosted URL:** 
   - `https://bucketname.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/objectname`
   - `https://bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/objectname`
3. **Note:** Virtual paths won't work for bucket names containing periods (`.`).

---

#### **Making an Object Public**
1. **Account-Level Blocking:**
   - Ensure "Block Public Access" is disabled at the account level.
2. **Bucket-Level Blocking:**
   - Disable "Block Public Access" for the specific bucket.
3. **Object-Level Setting:**
   - Use ACLs to make the object public:
     - Navigate to the object → Actions → Make public using ACL.

---

### **We have total 3 types of buckets.**

## **S3 Versioning**

### **Overview**
- S3 Versioning allows you to maintain multiple versions of an object within the same bucket.
- By default, versioning is in a **Suspended** state for any bucket.
- Once versioning is **enabled**, S3 will keep track of all versions of objects in the bucket.

### **Delete Behavior**
1. **Typing "Delete" when deleting an object:**  
   - S3 creates a **Delete Marker**, making the object invisible in the current version view.
   - You can delete the Delete Marker to recover the object.

2. **Typing "Permanently Delete" when deleting an object:**  
   - The object is permanently removed, and no Delete Marker is created.

### **Key Scenarios**
1. **Versioning Enabled:**
   - **HIDE Mode (Default View):**
     - Only the most recent version (current version) is visible.
     - Deleting an object adds a Delete Marker.
     - To recover the object, switch to "SHOW Versions," locate the Delete Marker, and remove it.
   - **SHOW Mode (Version View):**
     - All versions, including older ones and Delete Markers, are visible.
     - Deleting an object in this mode removes it permanently.

2. **Versioning Suspended:**
   - No version tracking occurs.
   - Deleting an object will permanently remove it.

---

## **Lifecycle Management Rules**

Lifecycle Management Rules help automate object transitions and deletions to optimize storage costs.

### **Scope of Rules**
- **Entire Bucket:** Apply rules to all objects in the bucket.
- **Prefix-Based Rules:** Apply rules to specific folders or object paths within the bucket.
- **Tag-Based Rules:** Apply rules only to objects with specific tags.

### **Sample Scenarios**
1. **S3 Standard → Standard-IA → Glacier → Delete**  
   Objects transition through Standard-IA (Infrequent Access) to Glacier and are eventually deleted.

2. **S3 Standard → Glacier → Delete**  
   Objects transition directly to Glacier and are deleted after a retention period.

3. **S3 Standard → Delete**  
   Objects remain in Standard storage before being deleted without transitioning to lower-cost tiers.

---

## **Replication Rules**

### **Cross-Region Replication (CRR) / Same-Region Replication (SRR)**
Replication ensures objects are copied from a source bucket to a destination bucket.

- **Requirements:**
  - Both source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled.
  - Existing objects are **not replicated**; only future uploads are replicated.
  - To replicate all existing objects, AWS offers **AWS Batch** job to replicate. **Cost US**

- **Replication Time Control (RTC):**
  - Guarantees data replication to the destination bucket within **15 minutes** for 99.99% of the data.
  - Additional costs apply for RTC.

### **Cost Considerations**
- **Data Transfer Between Regions:** Charges apply for data transfer.
- **Data Transfer Within a Region:** No cost for replication within the same region.

### **Manual Replication Using AWS CLI**
For one-time or scheduled replication, use the AWS CLI `sync` command:

```bash
aws s3 sync s3://source-bucket s3://target-bucket
```
- Schedule the command using:
  - **Windows Task Scheduler**
  - **Linux Cron Jobs** (e.g., daily replication at 12:00 AM).

## **Event Notifications**

### **When to Use S3 Event Notifications**  
S3 event notifications are helpful when you want to automate tasks or trigger actions in response to certain changes in your S3 bucket. Some common use cases include:  
- **Data Ingestion:** Notify downstream systems whenever a new file is uploaded to the bucket.  
- **Data Processing:** Trigger a Lambda function for image processing, transcoding videos, or extracting metadata from uploaded files.  
- **Monitoring and Alerting:** Use SNS to send alerts for object changes.  
- **Workflow Automation:** Integrate with SQS for queue-based workflows where other systems consume messages.

### **Available Destinations for Event Notifications**  
1. **SNS (Simple Notification Service):**  
   - Enables notifications to subscribers via email, SMS, or HTTP.  
   - **Free Tier:** 1,000 emails per month.  

2. **SQS (Simple Queue Service):**  
   - Reliable and scalable message queuing service.  
   - Suitable for decoupled systems where multiple consumers process events asynchronously.  

3. **Lambda:**  
   - Executes code in response to events.  
   - Ideal for on-the-fly transformations or actions without managing infrastructure.

### **Steps to Configure S3 Event Notifications**  
1. **Create or Identify the Destination:**  
   - For SNS: Create an SNS topic and add subscribers.  
   - For SQS: Set up a queue.  
   - For Lambda: Create the Lambda function.

2. **Modify Permissions:**  
   - **SNS-S3 Integration:**  
     - Update the SNS topic's **Access Policy** to allow S3 to publish messages.  
     - Example policy to allow everyone:  
       ```json
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": "*",
         "Action": "SNS:Publish",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:<region>:<account-id>:<topic-name>"
       }
       ```
   - Ensure your bucket policy allows events to be sent to the specified destination.

3. **Set Up the Notification on the S3 Bucket:**  
   - Go to the **Properties** tab of the bucket.  
   - Configure event notifications for specific events like **PUT**, **POST**, **DELETE**, or **Restore Object**.

4. **Test the Setup:**  
   - Perform an action on the bucket (e.g., upload a file).  
   - Verify that the event triggers the destination (e.g., email alert, queue message, or Lambda execution).

## **Using KMS with S3 for Encryption**

### **What is Encryption?**  
Encryption is the process of converting data into a secure format to prevent unauthorized access. Only authorized users with the correct decryption key can access the original data.

### **Importance of S3 Data Encryption**
- **Data Protection:** Ensures sensitive data is secure both during transmission and at rest.  
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Helps meet compliance requirements like GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA.  
- **Access Control:** Provides additional layers of security to control who can access or decrypt data.

---

### **Types of Encryption in S3**

#### **1. In-Transit Encryption:**  
- Protects data while being transmitted to or from S3.  
- **Technology Used:**  
  - **SSL (Secure Socket Layer)**  
  - **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**  

#### **2. Server-Side Encryption (SSE) (At Rest):**  
- Protects data stored on the S3 platform.  
- **Options:**  

1. **SSE-S3:**  
   - S3 manages encryption keys (AES-256).  
   - Suitable for public data.  
   - No direct access to key material by users.

2. **SSE-KMS (Key Management Service):**  
   - **AWS Managed Keys (aws/s3):**  
     - Default encryption keys created and managed by AWS KMS.  
     - Cannot be deleted.  
   - **Customer Managed Keys (CMK):**  
     - User-created keys.  
     - Requires permissions for both the S3 bucket and the encryption key.  
     - **Note:** Data encrypted with KMS keys cannot be made public.  

3. **SSE-C (Customer Provided Keys):**  
   - Customer provides key material to AWS.  
   - AWS uses it to encrypt and decrypt data.  
   - Customers can rotate or revoke keys anytime.  

#### **3. Client-Side Encryption (CSE):**  
- Encrypt data using your own tools before uploading it to S3.  
- AWS is not responsible for managing or decrypting the data.

---

### **Steps to Create a KMS Key for S3 Encryption**
1. **Choose Key Type:**  
   - Symmetric (S3 supports only symmetric keys).  
2. **Set Key Administrators:**  
   - Define who can manage the key.  
3. **Assign Key Users:**  
   - Grant access to users or services that will encrypt/decrypt data.  
4. **Review and Create the Key:**  
   - Confirm the configuration and create the key.

---

## **S3 Static Website Hosting**

### **Setup for Static Website Hosting**
1. **Bucket Configuration:**  
   - Create an S3 bucket with the same name as your domain (e.g., `learnaws.co.in`).  
   - Upload your static website files (HTML, CSS, JS).  

2. **Permissions:**  
   - Update the bucket policy to allow public read access.  

3. **Enable Static Website Hosting:**  
   - Go to the bucket’s **Properties** tab.  
   - Enable **Static Website Hosting** and set the index and error document (e.g., `index.html`, `error.html`).

4. **Access Your Website:**  
   - Use the static website endpoint, e.g.,  
     `http://learnaws.co.in.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com`

### **Common HTTP Status Codes**
- **2XX:** Success (e.g., 200 OK).  
- **3XX:** Redirection (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently).  
- **4XX:** Client Errors (e.g., 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found).  
- **5XX:** Server Errors (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).

## **Bucket Policies Overview**

### **When to Use Bucket Policies?**  
Bucket policies are used to define permissions at the bucket level for access control and operations. These policies allow you to:  
- **Control Access:** Manage permissions for individual IAM users, groups, roles, or other AWS accounts.  
- **Enforce Security:** Specify who can access the bucket and what actions are allowed or denied.  
- **Implement Restrictions:** Apply conditions, such as IP address restrictions, to enhance security.

### **Common Scenarios for Using Bucket Policies**  
1. **Restrict Public Access:** Prevent unauthorized public access to sensitive data.  
2. **Cross-Account Access:** Grant access to users from another AWS account.  
3. **Deny Specific Actions:** For example, deny users from deleting or overwriting objects.  
4. **Restrict IP Address Access:** Allow or deny bucket access based on source IP addresses.  
5. **Log Delivery:** Enable write permissions for AWS services like CloudTrail or S3 access logs.

---

### **Example Scenario: Deny Object Uploads to a Specific Bucket**

**Objective:** Deny the `PutObject` operation for a specific user on a bucket.  

#### **Key Details**  
- **Bucket ARN:** `arn:aws:s3:::avinash.bucket`  
- **IAM User ARN (Principal):** `arn:aws:iam::501170964283:user/s3user`  
- **Effect:** Deny  
- **Actions to Deny:** `s3:PutObject`, `s3:DeleteBucket`

#### **Bucket Policy Example**
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::501170964283:user/s3user"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:DeleteBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::avinash.bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::avinash.bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Understanding the Resources**
- **Bucket Level Operations:** Use `arn:aws:s3:::avinash.bucket` for actions that apply to the bucket itself (e.g., deleting the bucket).  
- **Object-Level Operations:** Use `arn:aws:s3:::avinash.bucket/*` for actions that apply to objects inside the bucket (e.g., uploading or deleting objects).  
- **For General Use:** Combine both, as shown above, when unsure whether the operation is at the bucket or object level.

---

## **S3 Object Lock**

### **What is Object Lock?**
S3 Object Lock is a feature that helps you prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten. This is particularly useful for ensuring compliance and protecting data against accidental or malicious deletion.

### **Prerequisites**
- **Versioning:** Must be enabled on the bucket before configuring Object Lock.

### **Modes of Object Lock**
1. **Governance Mode:**  
   - Allows users with specific IAM permissions to delete or overwrite locked objects during the retention period.  
   - Suitable for scenarios where administrative overrides are required.

2. **Compliance Mode:**  
   - Prevents all users, including root users, from deleting or overwriting objects during the retention period.  
   - Ideal for regulatory compliance or highly secure environments.

---

### **Steps to Enable Object Lock**
1. **Create a Bucket with Object Lock Enabled:**  
   - In the S3 Management Console, check the "Enable Object Lock" option during bucket creation.  

2. **Set Retention Configuration:**  
   - Navigate to the **Properties** tab of the bucket.  
   - Under **Object Lock**, configure retention settings (retention period, legal hold, etc.).  

3. **Test the Configuration:**  
   - Upload an object to the bucket.  
   - Verify that the object cannot be deleted or overwritten according to the mode (Governance or Compliance).

---

## **S3 Performance Overview**

### **Default Performance of an S3 Bucket**  
- **Write Operations:** Up to **3,500 PUT requests per second per prefix**.  
- **Read Operations:** Up to **5,500 GET requests per second per prefix**.  

### **How to Increase S3 Bucket Performance?**

1. **Increase Object Name Uniqueness:**  
   - Use random prefixes or date-based structures in object names to distribute workload across partitions.  
   - Example: Instead of `logs/file1.txt`, use `logs/2024/12/30/file1.txt`.

2. **Use More Prefixes:**  
   - Divide objects into multiple prefixes (folders) to spread requests.  
   - Example: Instead of storing all logs in `logs/`, use `logs/region1/` and `logs/region2/`.

---

## **Server Access Logging**

### **What is Server Access Logging?**  
Server access logging provides detailed records about the requests made to an S3 bucket, including the source of the request, the action performed, and the response. This is crucial for auditing and monitoring access to your data.

### **Reference:**  
[Amazon S3 Server Access Log Format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/LogFormat.html)

---

## **CloudTrail Data Events**

### **What are CloudTrail Data Events?**  
CloudTrail Data Events provide detailed insights into API activity at the data level for S3 buckets. It tracks actions such as `GetObject`, `PutObject`, and `DeleteObject`.  

### **Benefits**
- Logs activities for **current and future buckets**.  
- Provides enhanced security and auditing capabilities.

---

## **Requester Pays**

### **What is Requester Pays?**  
With the **Requester Pays** feature enabled, the person requesting the data pays for both the data transfer and request costs instead of the bucket owner.  

### **Key Points**
- **Anonymous access is disabled** automatically when this feature is enabled.  
- Ideal for public datasets where data consumers cover the costs.

---

## **Transfer Acceleration**

### **What is Transfer Acceleration?**  
Transfer Acceleration uses **AWS Edge Locations** to accelerate uploads and downloads to and from S3. It is particularly useful for users located far from the bucket’s AWS Region.  

### **Key Points**
- **Additional Cost:** Transfer Acceleration incurs extra charges.  
- Not supported for buckets with **periods (.)** in their names.

### **How to Test Transfer Acceleration?**
AWS provides a [speed comparison tool](https://s3-accelerate-speedtest.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/en/accelerate-speed-comparsion.html?region=ap-south-1&origBucketName=testbucket) to evaluate the performance benefits.

## **Storage Class Analysis**

### **What is Storage Class Analysis?**  
Storage Class Analysis helps you monitor and analyze storage access patterns to identify objects that can be transitioned to cheaper storage classes, such as S3 Standard-IA or S3 Glacier.

---

## **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**

### **What is CORS?**
CORS defines rules for sharing resources between different domains. For example, if a web application hosted on `example.com` needs to access images from an S3 bucket in `anotherdomain.com`, you need to configure CORS.

### **Common Use Cases**
- Allowing client-side scripts from a web application to access objects in S3.  
- Enabling dynamic image loading from S3 for websites.

### **Steps to Configure CORS on S3**
1. Open the **S3 Console** and select your bucket.  
2. Go to the **Permissions** tab.  
3. Scroll to **CORS Configuration** and click **Edit**.  
4. Add a JSON configuration, such as:
   ```json
   [
     {

## **S3 Consistency Model**

### **Consistency in S3**
1. **Read-After-Write Consistency:**  
   For new objects, once the upload is successful, you can immediately read the object.  
2. **Eventual Consistency:**  
   For updates or deletions, there might be a slight delay before the changes propagate.

## **Multipart Upload for Large Files**

### **When to Use Multipart Upload?**
- Recommended for files larger than **100 MB** and mandatory for files larger than **5 GB**.  
- If you upload large objects over a stable high-bandwidth network, use multipart upload to maximize the use of your available bandwidth by uploading object parts in parallel for multi-threaded performance.
- If you upload over a spotty network, use multipart upload to increase resiliency against network errors by avoiding upload restarts. When using multipart upload, you only need to retry uploading the parts that are interrupted during the upload. You don't need to restart uploading your object from the beginning.

### **Steps for Multipart Upload via CLI**
1. Use the AWS CLI to initiate the upload:
   ```bash
   aws s3 cp largefile.zip s3://your-bucket-name/ --part-size 10MB
   ```
